# 20240909 EDIT
Andrejbot was not updated in a while and it looks like it's not compatible with the new discord libraries. It can still run and appear online, but it no longer responds to commands. I will try to fix this issue when I'm in the mood to do so.

# AndrejBot
- simple discord bot made in node.js.
- the token you see here is invalid(security purposes).
- in case you want to see this bot working, obtain your own token and host it yourself or ask me for a showcase, I usualy do not have the time to respond tho.
